1. Architecture Diagram (architecture.jpg)


Elements to include:

User Wallet

Off-chain code (Transaction building, API calls)

On-chain validator (FundReleaseValidator)

FundDatum & FundAction structure (highlight fields like fdOwner, fdReceiver, fdSigned, fdMinApprovals, fdExpiry)

Cardano blockchain

Mind-map style layout:

User Wallet
   |
   v
Off-chain Code
   |---> Builds transaction with FundDatum + FundAction
   v
On-Chain Validator (FundReleaseValidator)
   |---> Validates: Sign / Withdraw / Reclaim
   v
Cardano Blockchain

2. Workflow Diagram (workflow.png)

Goal: Show the step-by-step execution of a fund release.

Sequence:

User sends request → Off-chain constructs transaction

Transaction contains datum & redeemer

Validator script checks:

Sign → Is the signer part of committee & not already signed?

Withdraw → Enough approvals & receiver signature?

Reclaim → Expired & insufficient approvals & owner signature?

If valid → funds released

Mind-map style layout:

[User Request]
      |
      v
[Off-Chain Code builds Tx]
      |
      v
[Validator Script]
      |---> Sign? (Committee check, not signed)
      |---> Withdraw? (Approvals >= Min, Receiver signed)
      |---> Reclaim? (Expired, Insufficient, Owner signed)
      |
      v
[FUNDS RELEASED on Blockchain]

3. Smart Contract Data Structure

Include as part of architecture diagram or separately:

FundDatum:
  fdOwner        :: PubKeyHash
  fdReceiver     :: PubKeyHash
  fdCommittee    :: [PubKeyHash]
  fdSigned       :: [PubKeyHash]
  fdMinApprovals :: Integer
  fdExpiry       :: POSIXTime

FundAction:
  Sign | Withdraw | Reclaim
